# CSML Syntax Highlighting

A syntax highlighting for CSML code.

## Features

It provides tokenization for CSML code, so the VS Code theme you are using could color the code syntax. 
It uses TextMate grammar structure to write the tokenization as it is the engine used in VS Code.
There is some cases not implemented, as nested strings, but is a working in progress and you can contribute :).

## Intalling 

To use this syntax you need to download this folder in VSCode extensions folder:
- Linux and MAC: `$HOME/.vscode/extensions/`
- Windows: `%USERPROFILE%\.vscode\extensions`
